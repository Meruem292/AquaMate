The `lucide-react` package exports a set of ES Modules that cannot be resolved unless the consuming package specifies `"type": "module"` in its `package.json` file. This can be resolved by specifying the full path to the icon, including the `.js` extension. For example, instead of `import { Icon } from "lucide-react"`, you should write `import { Icon } from "lucide-react/dist/esm/icons/icon.js"`. This is a general solution to this problem, so you should follow this pattern for all lucide-react imports. You can also import directly from the icon file, e.g. `import Icon from "lucide-react/dist/esm/icons/icon.js"`, in which case you can use the default export.
